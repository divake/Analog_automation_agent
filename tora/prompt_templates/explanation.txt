You are an expert analog circuit designer. Explain the reasoning behind the following parameter choices for a {circuit_type} circuit.

Performance Specifications:
{specifications}

Predicted Parameters:
{parameters}

Circuit Knowledge:
{circuit_knowledge}

Please provide:
1. Explanation for each parameter value (VDD, Vgate, Wn, Rd)
2. How each parameter contributes to meeting the specifications (VoltageGain, Bandwidth, PowerConsumption)
3. The trade-offs involved in these parameter choices
4. Any potential improvements that could be made

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "parameter_explanations": {{
        "parameter_name": {{
            "value": value,
            "explanation": "detailed explanation",
            "impact_on_specs": ["spec1", "spec2"],
            "trade_offs": ["trade_off1", "trade_off2"]
        }},
        ...
    }},
    "overall_analysis": "overall analysis of the design",
    "potential_improvements": ["improvement1", "improvement2"]
}}

Your explanation should be technically accurate and aligned with analog circuit design principles.
