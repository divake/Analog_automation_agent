Important data-driven insights from circuit dataset analysis:
1. Parameter sensitivity (typical impact):
   - VDD: A change of 0.03V typically changes gain by 0.12
   - Vgate: A change of 0.02V typically changes bandwidth by 21.78MHz
   - Wn: A change of 3.50e-07 typically changes power by 0.00006W
   - Rd: A change of 125Ω typically changes gain by 0.39

2. For target specifications (gain≈4.8, bandwidth≈577MHz, power≈0.00279W):
   Parameter combinations from dataset that achieve similar specifications:
   - VDD=1.70V, Vgate=0.90V, Wn=8.00e-06, Rd=900Ω
     Results: Gain=4.79, BW=577.00MHz, Power=0.002790W
     
   - VDD=1.40V, Vgate=0.90V, Wn=9.00e-06, Rd=600Ω
     Results: Gain=6.27, BW=592.00MHz, Power=0.002680W

3. Suggested parameter adjustment strategies:
   - To increase gain: Increase Rd (strongest positive correlation: 0.45)
   - To increase bandwidth: Decrease Rd (correlation: -0.56) or increase Wn (correlation: 0.29)
   - To decrease power: Decrease VDD (correlation: 0.35) or decrease Wn (correlation: 0.28)

Please provide:
1. Analysis of the simulation results compared to target specifications (VoltageGain, Bandwidth, PowerConsumption)
2. Suggested parameter adjustments to improve performance (VDD, Vgate, Wn, Rd)
3. Reasoning behind each suggested adjustment
4. Expected impact of adjustments on circuit performance
