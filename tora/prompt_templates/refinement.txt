You are an expert analog circuit designer. Based on simulation results, suggest refinements to the parameters of a {circuit_type} circuit.

Target Specifications:
{specifications}

Current Parameters:
{parameters}

Simulation Results:
{simulation_results}

Specification Differences (Achieved vs Target):
{specification_differences}

Circuit Knowledge:
{circuit_knowledge}

Please provide:
1. Analysis of the simulation results compared to target specifications (VoltageGain, Bandwidth, PowerConsumption)
2. Suggested parameter adjustments to improve performance (VDD, Vgate, Wn, Rd)
3. Reasoning behind each suggested adjustment
4. Expected impact of adjustments on circuit performance

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "analysis": "analysis of simulation results",
    "parameter_adjustments": {{
        "parameter_name": {{
            "current_value": current_value,
